url <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fivethirtyeight/guns-data/master/full_data.csv"

```{r, include = FALSE}

  filter(age <= 65)
```

We have data about `r nrow(gun_deaths)` gun deaths. Only 
`r nrow(gun_deaths) - nrow(youth)` are of age <= 65. The distribution of the remainder is shown
below:


```{r, echo = FALSE}
youth %>% 
  ggplot(aes(age)) + 
  geom_freqpoly(binwidth = 1)
```


```{r race-dist, echo = FALSE}
youth %>% 
  ggplot(aes(fct_infreq(race) %>% fct_rev())) + geom_bar() +
  coord_flip() + labs(x= "Victim Race")
```
